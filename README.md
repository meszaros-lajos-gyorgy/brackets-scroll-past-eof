# Scroll past EOF

A plugin for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/)
which allows you to scroll below the document, stopping at the last line at top.

This plugin attempts to bring the same functionality to Brackets, as the
ScrollPastEOF plugin does for [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

The plugin is far from optimal and lack support for horizontally split screens.
